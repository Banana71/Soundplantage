Performances for the miniDexed 

The Yamaha DX7 is one of the most expressive electronic musical instruments I know. Thanks to its versatility, it can produce sounds for every musical genre. This is especially true of the miniDexed with its 8 tone generators.

I would be grateful for suggestions, criticism and ideas of all kinds in the Discussions.
