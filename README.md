Performances for the miniDexed 

The Yamaha DX7 is certainly not the best sounding synthesizer, but there is hardly another electronic instrument that can be played so expressively. 
Thanks to its versatility, it can produce sounds for any genre of music. This is especially true for the miniDexed with its 8 tone generators.
