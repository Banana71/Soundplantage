**Performances for the miniDexed**

The Yamaha DX7 is one of the most expressive electronic musical instruments I know. Its remarkable versatility allows it to generate sounds suitable for virtually any musical genre.

This versatility is even more pronounced with the **miniDexed**, which features eight independent tone generators (TGs). The performances provided here make use of multiple TGs. Except for the drum kits, each performance is built around a single sound and receives MIDI note input on **channel 1**.

Feel free to explore, adapt, and modify these performances to suit your own musical needs.

Instructions for saving and copying performances can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Banana71/Soundplantage/wiki).
